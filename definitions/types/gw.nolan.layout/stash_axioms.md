# gw.nolan.layout — stashed axioms (deferred)

The `x-gridworks.axioms` for `gw.nolan.layout/000`, lifted out of `000.yaml` so the type
generates a runtime **without** axiom validators (per hardware-layout-pass-one — full layouts
now, axioms implemented later). To re-enable, drop this block back under `x-gridworks:` in
`000.yaml`. Markdown (not yaml) so sema tooling/tests skip it.

This is the reference list of structural axioms we march through for **many** layouts
(house0, nolan, …). Two pass-one revisions to the channel↔component cluster below — apply them
when porting, don't re-enable the stale forms verbatim:

- **`ComponentConfigListExistence` is dropped.** A component carries a `ConfigList` only when it has
  per-channel hardware binding (ADS terminal blocks, eGauge registers, thermistor types). A no-binding
  component (relay multiplexer, flow module, pico tank/flow/btu, gw108 gpio, hubitat, web server) has
  **no `ConfigList`** — a bare `{ChannelName}` list is information-free redundancy. The bare base
  `channel.config` type is **removed** entirely; only the specialty `*.channel.config` types remain.
- **`ComponentDataChannelBijection` (global `C == D`) is revised** to a **per-component local bijection**
  (only for components that *have* a `ConfigList`), composing with `ChannelCaptureConsistency`.
- **`CaptureNodeHasComponent` is added** (below, after `ChannelBindingIntegrity`) to recover the
  "captured by a real component" guarantee the dropped global bijection used to give for free. The
  by-*kind* capability check (the component is a *kind* that can capture the channel) stays **deferred to
  pass-two** with the i2c board model — see the `DEFERRED (pass-2)` marker below.

        Device-type membership. Every Component's DeviceType SHALL be a member of the
        `gw1.device.type` enum. Furthermore, for every Component whose DeviceType requires a
        specialized device-type record (a category that carries category-level data beyond
        its name — e.g. an electric meter, an ADS111x-based sensor, a GW108 board), the
        DeviceTypes array SHALL contain a `<family>.device.type.gt` whose DeviceType value
        equals the Component's DeviceType. A Component whose category carries no
        category-level data needs no record. Consistency is a layout invariant, not a
        per-component flag.

        DRAFT / DEFERRED ENFORCEMENT (this layout is draft, so this axiom is

        ComponentAttributeClassId SHALL equal the canonical id assigned to that
        MakeModel by the GridWorks MakeModel -> ComponentAttributeClassId mapping;
        a DeviceType with MakeModel UnknownMake__UnknownModel MAY use any UUID. This
        is the in-canon home for the bijection currently hardcoded in scada
        (CACS_BY_MAKE_MODEL, component_attribute_class_gt.py). Enforcement stays
        scada-side for now; this axiom goes live when the mapping is formalized as
        gw1.* vocabulary (a gw1.cac.id enum + a gw1.make.model.cac.id projection)
        and this layout type publishes. TODO: formalize the gw1.* projection and
        migrate enforcement from scada into this axiom. Rationale: enforcing here (on
        the layout, the cross-system artifact) keeps device-type + components
        version-stable while making the layout self-validating; enforcing on the
        device-type itself would version-couple it to the mapping and ripple on
        every device-type addition.

        1000/DataRateSps plus ~10 ms measured overhead; the 0.6 bound keeps the
